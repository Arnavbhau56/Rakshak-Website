            <dt>1. Aerodynamics :</dt>
            <dd class="text"> All the CFD analysis required to meet the given performance requirements is carried out.</dd>

            <dt>2. Structures :</dt>
            <dd class="text"> CAD modelling and structural analysis of the plane body is done in this group.</dd>

            <dt>3. Payload :</dt>
            <dd class="text"> Designing the payload deployment mechanism for the precise delivery of the freight.</dd>

            <dt>4. UGV :</dt>
            <dd class="text"> Development of an unmanned ground vehicle to be deployed as a payload to carry the necessary goods to the exact location on the map.</dd>

        <img src="Images/software.png" class="img-1">

        <p class="text">The Software subsystem is responsible for the onboard processing and analysis of the images collected during the mission. This includes identifying the potential targets, classifying them and geotagging them for future purpose. The subsystem is categorised into : </p>

        
        <dl>
            
            <dt>1. Object detection and Classification :</dt>
            <dd class="text"> Identifying the potential targets and classifying them with precision. The identified objects are then geotagged.</dd>

            <dt>2. Interoperability :</dt>
            <dd class="text">Responsible for autonomous update of detected targets to the server.</dd>

            <h2 class="heading" id='3'>Controls and Communication Subsytem</h2>
    
            <img src="Images/controls.png" class="img-1">
    
            <p class="text">The subsystem conducts regular tests for sensor calibration and adjusting the gains of the controller. The UAV is given various flight paths during the test to assess the performance of the UAV and accordingly modify the control parameters to achieve acceptable performance. The flight path is developed using path planning algorithms to avoid pre-identified obstacles. Communication is responsible for proper communication between plane & ground control station and interoperability, i.e., autonomous collection of mission plan data from a remote server and upload of collected data to the server.</p>

            <p class="text">Marketing Subsystem Deals with the all non-technical work like design, publicity, bringing the sponsors for the team, handling accounts and logistics of our team. The current sponsor for the team is Boeing (from the Aerospace Department). This subsystem is responsible for Monetary association with sponsors, Technical association with leading industries, Overseeing outside vendors and agencies, Publicise the team on every social media account, Design & Graphics related work of the team</p>
