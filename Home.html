    <p id ="ab">Rakshak IITB is the official tech team of IIT Bombay comprising of 40+ understudies from different disciplines who work collaboratively to create a armada of vigorous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to support search and Rescue Operations (SRO) within the occasion of a catastrophe. The team was shaped within the year 2015 by a few of the IITB devotees to construct drones/planes that can be utilized for rescue missions. These flying machine can give alleviation measures within the disaster-stricken zone (e.g., Landslide, Flood, Earthquake) and can be utilized for overviews & mapping of cities and preservation of natural life with slight alterations. Our plan productively handles the over issues cost-effectively without compromising on human security. </p>

    <br>

    <p id="ac">As of presently, we have created five planes. Each year we are attempting to extend our limits by our advancement and collaboration. We would too like to thank IITB for supporting us and giving the stage to grandstand our ability at the universal level.</p>
